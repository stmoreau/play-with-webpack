# todoMVC-to-react-with-graph

This is a simple todo application that I *transpiled* from Vanilla JS to React practicing a lot of __webpack__ feautures.

## Technologies used:

- React
- webpack
- d3
- lodash
- surge
- karma
- chai
- ...

## Installation
- `npm install`
- see `package.json` for all the available scripts
